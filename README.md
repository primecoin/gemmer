### 0.3.12 Developer Release

For developer preview and testing only.

NOTE: Hot fix for wayawolfcoin key export. Key export/backup must be performed
anew for wayawolfcoin if it was done in 0.3.11 version. This issue only
applies to wayawolfcoin. Other coins/tokens are NOT affected.

Please note: 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer are no longer supported.
If you have tested 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer, these older
versions will not be updated any more and will not be overwritten by newer
releases of gemmer. Please transfer all coins out of older gemmer wallet.
Remember you must NOT uninstall the older versions of gemmer before coins
have been transferred out of the wallet. Uninstallation of app irreversibly
destroys the wallet and keys stored with the app.
