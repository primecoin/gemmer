# gemmer
Minimalist multi-wallet by Primecoin Project and Crane Square

### 0.2.5 Alpha Release

Alpha release is meant for limited trial use only. Use at one's own risks.

Please note: 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer are no longer supported.
If you have tested 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer, these older
versions will not be updated any more and will not be overwritten by newer
releases of gemmer. Please transfer all coins out of older gemmer wallet.
Remember you must NOT uninstall the older versions of gemmer before coins
have been transferred out of the wallet. Uninstallation of app irreversibly
destroys the wallet and keys stored with the app.
