# gemmer
Minimalist multi-wallet by Primecoin Project and Crane Square

### 0.2.7 Developer Release

For developer preview and testing only.

Please note: 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer are no longer supported.
If you have tested 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer, these older
versions will not be updated any more and will not be overwritten by newer
releases of gemmer. Please transfer all coins out of older gemmer wallet.
