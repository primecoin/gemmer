# gemmer
Minimalist multi-wallet by Primecoin Project and Crane Square

### 0.2.29 Beta Release

Public beta. Use at one's own risks. Key backup strongly recommended.

Please note: 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer are no longer supported.
If you have tested 0.2.3 and earlier versions of gemmer, these older
versions will not be updated any more and will not be overwritten by newer
releases of gemmer. Please transfer all coins out of older gemmer wallet.
